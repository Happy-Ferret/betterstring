    * all makefiles: all makefiles were still accessing the no longer existing
      directory "includes" instead of "include".

2007-01-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * misc: updated all copyright notices to 2007.
    * mcp/locale/french.ct: added french catalog translation kindly provided
      by Philippe Bovier.

2006-11-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcp/locale/svenska.ct: added swedish catalog translation kindly provided
      by PÃr Boberg.

2006-10-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * includes/SDI_#?, misc: updated to latest versions and updated our sources
      accordingly.

2006-09-30 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

    * mcc/hotkeystring/HandleInput.c: fixed bug #1568031 where a wrong index
      calculation which shifted all F-keys and cursor keys by one, making all
      inputs wrong.
    * mcc/Debug.c, mcp/Debug.c, mcc/hotkeystring/Debug.c: corrected several
      wrong class names in the debug output.

#### v11.8 RELEASE ############################################################
 
2006-08-20  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc/HandleInput.c: fixed bug #1218170 where on "MUIA_String_Secret"
      enabled objects the doubleclicking marking of text should not select
      single words.
    * mcc/HandleInput.c: on double-clicked into a betterstring gadget, text
      passages will only be marked if the user really always clicked on the
      very same position in the string. Otherwise marking will be removed.
    * mcc/InitConfig.c: fixed a bug in the font name parsing/loading routines
      which didn't work as expected and could crash a machine under certain
      situations.
    * misc: replaced all bufferoverflow prone functions like sprintf() against
      safe functions.
    * mcc/Dispatcher.c: if a BetterString gadget moves into 'Inactive' state,
      eventually selected content will be automatically unselected as it is done
      with the default MUI string class.
    * misc: switched all OS4 builds to compile against newlib.library.
    * misc: updated 'mccheader.c' include file from latest TextEditor.mcc
      sources and also applied the new Debug.c,h interface to all our subprojects.
    * mcc/hotkeystring/HandleInput.c: fixed the OS4 build to use the new media
      key definitions instead.

2005-07-30  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc/hotkeystring/HandleInput.c: changed the rawkey based wheelmouse name to
      carry a "nm_" prefix so that it refers to newmouse based wheelmouse events
      and doesn't conflict with the new wheelmouse events in AmigaOS4.

#### v11.7 RELEASE ############################################################

2005-07-07  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc/library.c: added missing USEDCLASSESP define so that MUI knowns
      which mcp class belongs to the mcc.

2005-07-07  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

    * mcc/hotkeystring/HandleInput.c: changed CONST CONST_STRPTR back to
      const char *, as requested.

2005-07-04  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

    * mcc/hotkeystring/HandleInput.c: made small changes only to create
      (possibly) smaller code.

2005-07-03  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc/GetSetAttrs.c: fixed a minor bug in the MUIA_String_Integer set
      method which prevented it from correctly converting the supplied
      integer into a string and therefore left the method defective.

2005-07-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc/hotkeystring/HandleInput.c: added missing <proto/intuition.h>
      include statements which prevent compilation with OS4 SDK (missing
      SetAttrs)

2005-06-30  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * mcc/HandleInput.c (ConvertKey): fix signedness bug.
    * mcc/hotkeystring/HandleInput.c (ConvertKey): Likewise.

2005-06-24  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * mcc/AllocBitMap.c: Free allocated bitmap on failure in non-V39 case.
      Move version check into USE_OS3 #define.
      (MUIG_AllocBitMap): Improved friend handling.
    * mcc/AllocFunctions.c: Minor changes.

2005-06-16  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * mcc/HandleInput.c: Fix OS3 MySPrintf for GCC 3.4.x or newer (has to
      use stdarg.h macros!). Small cleanup (eg. STRPTR -> char*).

2005-06-15  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

    * mcc/hotkeystring/Makefile.os3: Added $(CPU) to $LDFLAGS. Added INCDIR=
      setting and used it where appropriate.
    * mcc/hotkeystring/HotkeyString-Test.c Added libraries/iffparse.h for
      MAKE_ID define. Includes cleanup.
    * mcc/hotkeystring/private.h: Replaced proto/mui.h with libraries/mui.h.
    * mcc/hotkeystring/HandleInput.c: Replaced STRPTR and friends with char*
      (thats what standard functions use!). Include and code cleanup.

2005-06-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc/hotkeystring: replaced the fixed values for the special OS4/MOS keys
      by a more general set of RAWKEY_ defines already common on both platforms
    * mcc/hotkeystring: fixed a whole bunch of compiler warnings
    * mcc: fixed a bunch of compiler warnings

2005-06-13  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc/TextFunctions.c: replace our own MyTextLength/MyTextFit with the 
      standard OS TextLength/TextFit functions as they work exactly the same
      and are hopefully less buggy.

2005-05-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * library.c: added missing USE_UTILITYBASE define which may have caused 
      problems on OS3 machines.

2005-05-19  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc/TextFunctions.c: adapted sources to the already fixed function
      equivalents used in TextEditor.mcc.

2005-05-03  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

    * mcc/hotkeystring/HandleInput.c: Added missing key codes for MorphOS
      and AmigaOS4 (may contain wrong codes).
    * mcc/hotkeystring/HandleInput.c: Added media keys.
    * mcc/hotkeystring/Dispatcher.c (OM_SET):
      Added MUIA_HotkeyString_IX tag. Takes struct InputXpression as data
      and sets a gadget contents accordingly.
    * misc: Restored spaces to ChangeLog.

2005-05-03  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * mcc/HandleInput.c: fixed an uninitialized variable by integrating
      the proposed patch of bug 1193352 from Georg Steger.
    * misc: integrated minor patches kindly provided by Gunther Nikl
      and modified sources to properly compile with gcc versions < 3.

2005-04-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

    * initial LGPL release published at sf.net

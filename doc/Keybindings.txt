BetterString keybindings:

 Marking text
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
   You can mark text either using the mouse, or the keyboard.
   If you hold down control and move the cursor, then the gadget will
   automatically mark.
   You can also press and hold LMB over the first character, and move the
   mouse to select text.
   If you have marked some text and want to expand the block, then hold down
   control, while you press LMB.
   Lastly there is the possibility to double or tripple click, to select a
   word or the complete string. If you doubleclick, then you can move the
   mouse to select more words.
